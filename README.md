## 🛠️ What Is .NET MAUI?

.NET MAUI is the evolution of Xamarin.Forms — a single codebase framework for building native apps on:

- **Android**
- **iOS**
- **macOS**
- **Windows**

It ships as part of .NET and is fully supported by Microsoft. As of .NET 10 (LTS), MAUI is distributed via NuGet packages for finer dependency control and supports Native AOT, .NET Aspire integration, and a new XAML source generator.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install the MAUI workload
dotnet workload install maui

# Create a new MAUI app
dotnet new maui -n MyFirstMauiApp

# Build and run
cd MyFirstMauiApp
dotnet build
```
